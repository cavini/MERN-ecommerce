This is a basic project to showcase my abilities to work with the MERN stack in a E-commerce CRUD application.

**** W.I.P ****

To run this app, go to the root folder, install all the dependencies and then run 'npm run dev'.
If you want to see only the backend working, type 'npm run server'.


TECH STACK:

React
Redux
MongoDB
Bootstrap
Express
